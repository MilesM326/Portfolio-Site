excerpt: I wanted to experiment using facial recognition, comment sentiment analyzers and webscraping to make a scientific assessment about the social media spaces that I and many others are exposed to on a daily basis. I learned how to adopt and utilize different machine learning models, as well as use YouTubeâ€™s API to create my own webscraper.
