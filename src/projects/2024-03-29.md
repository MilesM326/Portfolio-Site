    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>For my freshman year introduction to mechanical engineering class, I was tasked with designing a biologically-inspired hopper. The goal of this project was to analyze and execute a means to store potential energy and release it such that the hopper would jump.</p>
    
    Further guidelines were given to:
    <ul>
        <li>Design a trigger/timer following an 8 second or more delay.</li>
        <li>Have the entirety of our design hop.</li>
        <li>Define a personal design goal to incorporate.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Materials for the project were limited to a kit provided to us.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My biological inspiration primarily comes from two animals: locusts, for their complex energy storage and release mechanism in their legs, and kangaroos, which influenced the aesthetic design of my hopper.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The mechanics of my hopper draw heavily from the latch-and-snap mechanism found in various jumping insects. For example, locusts can leap several times their body length by spring-loading their hind legs. Their powerful leg muscles bend the joints backward, locking them in place with a specialized mechanism. When released, the legs snap downward, propelling the insect forward like a biological catapult.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The appearance of my hopper takes inspiration from the form and posture of a kangaroo, emphasizing its distinctive hind-leg-driven movement and balanced stance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My initial prototype explored the mechanical aspects of the hopper, more specifically, the latch-and-snap concept and its application on a double jointed leg. I began with a sketch of the body party, the connections of the body parts, as well as a tail for ground stability. Arrows were drawn to highlight the interaction between the latch and the legs, and between the legs and the ground.</p>
    <br>
    <p> A short dowel connects the body to the thighs by swivel joints. A second, longer dowel runs through the knee joints of the left and right legs. In order to imitate the latch-and-snap, a rubberband is run from one knee dowel, then under its hip, wrap over the notch on the back and under the other sides hip, and finaly hooked on the other knee giving elasticity to the legs when when compressed. Two levers on either side of the body act as triggers, hooking the calfs in place.</p>
    
    <p></p>
    <h5>Initial Prototype & Challenges</h5>
    
    The first model focused primarily on the leg mechanism. While it successfully demonstrated hopping in rare cases, it presented several challenges:
    <ul>
        <li>Trigger Mechanism– Difficulty in engaging the hooks while keeping the modelupright.</li>
        <li>Component Fit– Hinges did not accommodate the ¼-inch dowel withoutcadditional modifications.</li>
        <li>Scale Issues– The prototype was too small to integrate additional components, such as a timer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Fixes in the Second Design</h5>
    The next iteration addressed these limitations, refining both function and form:
    <ul>
        <li>Improved Kangaroo-Like Shape– More accurate proportions corrected previous scale and depth issues.</li>
        <li>Leg Mechanics & Stability– The dowel connecting the knees now runs along a track to prevent hyperextension.</li>
        <li>Internal Rubber Band System– Moved from external placement to inside the structure, optimizing efficiency.</li>
        <li>Reliable Locking Mechanism– Additional space allowed for a more effective locking system, preventing unintended movement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Current Challenge & Next Steps</h5>
    
    While the updated model improves mechanical function, it is too front-heavy, affecting stability. The next step is to add a tail as a counterweight, enhancing balance and ensuring consistent, controlled hopping.
