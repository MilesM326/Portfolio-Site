excerpt: Developed and implemented soft-sensors to create a squishy, flexible sleeve to attach onto a hard robotic arm allowing it to react to human interaction and proximity. This project positioned me in a leadership role, responsible for task management and assignment, product design and creation, software architecture and development, and project organization and documentation.
