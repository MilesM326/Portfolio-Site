            I'm Miles. I'm a recent grad from Wesleyan University with a major in Computer Science and minors in East Asian Studies and Design & Engineering.

           I was born in Manhattan and raised in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, but I also have dual citizenship in Germany. Besides mostly speaking English and German, I also speak some Japanese, Chinese, and a little bit of Spanish.

           When I'm not coding, I like to play basketball at Brooklyn Bridge Park, and unsurprisingly, my favorite team are the Nets. I've been playing the cello since the 3rd grade and try to keep up with it as much as possible. Other than classical music, I like listening to Rap, R&B, Jazz and more recently, Hiphop. Unrelated, I rediscovered Lupe Fiasco's "Tetsuo & Youth" and have been really enjoying it.
