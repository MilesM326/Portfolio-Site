          Hey, I'm Miles. I'm a senior at Wesleyan University studying Computer Science with minors in East Asian Studies and Design & Engineering.
          I was raised in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn with my 3 older sisters and I love learning new hobbies.
          Since my father is from Freeport, Trinidad, and my mother is from Frankfurt, Germany, I mostly speak English and German.
          I also speak a little Japanese and Chinese, and I'm teaching myself Spanish.
          When I'm not coding, I like to play basketball at Brooklyn Bridge Park&#8212 unsurprisingly, my favorite team is the Nets.
          I've been playing the cello since the 3rd grade and try to play as much as possible, so let me know if you need a cellist (as long as it's not just whole notes :P ).
          Other than classical music, I'm a fan of Jazz, R&B, and Rap. Some of my favorite artists are Wes Montgomery, The Internet, and Kendrick Lamar to name a few.
