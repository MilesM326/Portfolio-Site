        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>In my 'Introduction to Mechanical Engineering' class freshman year, I was tasked with designing a biologically-inspired hopper. The goal of this project was to analyze and implement a means to store potential energy and release it making the hopper jump.</p>
        <p>Project guidelines were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing a trigger and/or timer following an 8 second or more delay.</li>
            <li>Having the entirety of our design hop.</li>
            <li>Define a personal design goal to incorporate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Materials for the project were limited to a kit provided to us.</p>

    <h3>Final Design</h3>
    <p>The completed design took inspiration from two animals: locusts, for their complex energy storage and release mechanism in their legs; and kangaroos, which influenced the aesthetic design of my hopper.</p>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>I measured this hopper as a rotational hopper. Due to a dowel I added to have the rubber band pull in a certain direction this isn’t an exact measurement. The total mass of my hopper ended up being .048kg (48g). Assuming that U=.229 is accurate. My hopper would have an estimated peak height of .48 meters the actual height of the jump was .1 meters giving my hopper an efficiency of ~20%</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>All iterations were designed in SOLIDWORKS2021 before being lasercut on an Epilog Machine</p>
<div class="article__section">
    <div class="section-text">
        <h3>Construction of Prototype 1</h3>
<p><p>Originally, I chose a deer as the design inspiration, thought my sketches quickly highlighted the complications of an effecient jumping quadruped. Rather than getting four legs to jump, I opted for a bipedal animal. Hence, the appearance of my hopper takes after the kangaroo, emphasizing its distinctive hind-leg-driven movement and balanced stance.</p></p>
<p><p>With regards to the mechanics of my hopper, I wanted to incorperate the latch-and-snap mechanism found in various jumping insects. For example, locusts can leap several times their body length by spring-loading their hind legs, bending the joints backward, locking them in place with a specialized mechanism. When released, the legs snap downward, propelling the insect forward like a biological catapult.</p>
<img src="/assets/projects/Kangaroo_Hopper/v1sketch.jpg"/>
<p>My initial prototype explored the mechanical aspects of the hopper, more specifically, it was a proof-of-concept for the latch-and-snap design sketched and its application on a double hinged leg.</p>
<br></p>
<p><p>Additionally, I brainstormed ideas for a timer which included...</p>

<p> A short dowel connects the body to the thighs by swivel joints. A second, longer dowel runs through the knee joints of the left and right legs. A rubberband is run from one knee dowel, then under its hip, wrap over the notch on the back and under the other sides hip, and finaly hooked on the other knee giving elasticity to the legs when when compressed. Two levers on either side of the body act as triggers, hooking the shins in place.</p>
<div>
<h4>Prototype Challenges</h4>
<p>This prototype focused primarily on the function of the legs and trigger. While it successfully demonstrated hopping, it presented several challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale was too small to integrate additional components, like timer.</li>
<li>Inconsistent trigger mechanism due to friction on lever hinge and between lever hooks and shins.</li>
<li>Difficulty balancing model on legs due to lack of feet and freely rotating knees.</li>
<li>Inconvenient design for resetting legs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Construction of Prototype 2</h3>
<p>The next iteration addressed these limitations, improving both function and form.</p>
<img src="/assets/projects/Kangaroo_Hopper/v2sketch.jpg"/>
<p>This is what I improved on</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the scructure adding two kangaroo silluhettes </li>
<li>Leg Mechanics &amp; Stability– The dowel connecting the knees now runs along a track to prevent hyperextension.</li>
<li>Internal Rubber Band System– Moved from external placement to inside the structure, optimizing efficiency.</li>
<li>Reliable Locking Mechanism– Additional space allowed for a more effective locking system, preventing unintended movement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Prototype Challenges</h4>
<p>what went wrong with prototype 2</p>
<ul>
<li>thing 1</li>
<li>thing 2</li>
<li>thing 3</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Fine-tuning to achieve the final version</h3></p>
<p><p>My 3rd model eventually became my last. I added a tail piece that would act as extra stability, and I turned the legs into one piece. The dowel at the knee remained and I also added a track for the 3/8 ball to roll down onto the see saw. With some minor tweaks to the overall shape the ball was able to consistently trigger. Furthermore, I had issues with...</p>

<div>
<h4>Timer</h4>
<p>All that remained was a timer. The track that I had initially wanted to do did not provide enough delay, so I added arms that, unless all the way down prevented the ball from rolling. In order to delay the arms I had the arms hold one magnet and placed a magnet up by the mouth. In between the two magnets I stuck an earplug that would slowly separate the arms to where the magnets could not hold on anymore.</p>

</div></p>
</div>
<h3>Current Challenge & Possible Next Steps</h3>
<div class>
    <p>While the updated model improves mechanical function, it is too front-heavy, affecting stability. The next step is to add a tail as a counterweight, enhancing balance and ensuring consistent, controlled hopping.</p>
