# My-Website
My first website to blog my past, and current projects. I'm using 11ty and nunjucks to dynamically build static websites from a folder of markdown files. This allows me to easily make new posts and have it automatically update throughout the site pages without having to rewrite each page.

This is still in-progress. I'm currently working on the design page, tweaking CSS to adjust the look and feel of everything.
